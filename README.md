# Community Capacity
## Purpose
1. Sharing ideas for building community capacity and resilience (this is done in the **'wiki'** pages - see the wiki link above)
2. To delevelop actual useful design or ideas locally for how things might work, ie. blueprints to your idea to share and develop with the community, project plans, workshops, events etc. (This is done in the **'Code'** - see the link above.  This sounds technical but it really isnt)

## Suggested use of this site:
1. Review the good practice pages in the Wiki pages and propose your own to add to the library
2. Create an **'Issue'** to discuss a topic around any of the good practice examples or to create an activity that you believe is needed to progress the aims
4. Create a **'Project'** to initiate any of the good practice examples (the **Help.MD** file will develop and expand on this) but simply speaking this tool can be used to develop and share online project plans and the outputs you/ we develop.
5. Add other resources that may be useful such as designs, plans etc which the community can add to and improve
6. Engage with materials on the respository (this repository is basically a site or pages that anyone can create and is to do with their subject on Github, i.e. 'CommunityCapacity' is a repository) and the repository may contain materials such as the local vision for Walsall.  Please note however that this vision is not owned by anyone organisation but rather the community of colloborators which emerges.

## What this repository is not
* Whilst it can be used for and by the general public, this repository is for volunteers, professionals and citizens to co-create, co-design and co-produce outputs; it is not a mainstream communication channel however for any sector or organisation
* This repository is not an organisationally 'owned' hosted site or resource but rather a 'shared' community resource to help generate ideas through colloboration across diverse communities and parties. 
* Github as a tool whilst predominantly used for hosting computer programming code projects **is not exclusively** used as such. 
* Github is an under-used *'free'* colloborative tool that could help generate greater co-production in health and social care.  [See the SCIE website for details on coproduction](https://www.scie.org.uk/publications/guides/guide51/).

You could start by taking a look at folder containing good practise in the wiki
https://github.com/DickyUK/CommunityCapacity/wiki

You can create your own community project
https://github.com/DickyUK/CommunityCapacity/projects

You can create **'issues'** which are basically tasks, problems, challenges, improvements to new or existing community health and wellbeing provision. Issues can be tagged with Labels and to a Project you have created. You can also engage in discussion with others on any 'Issues' and use simple emoji social media like conversation, e.g. happy, sad, confused etc.
https://github.com/DickyUK/CommunityCapacity/issues

You can create a **'Pull Request'** for 'Code' (i.e. designs, such as a vision or a community service, a business case etc), which puts ideas for you recommendations and improvements back to the original author, or create a clone or fork and develop your own strand.

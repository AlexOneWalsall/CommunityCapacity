# Community Capacity
## Purpose
1. Sharing ideas for building community capacity and resilience (this is done in the wiki pages)
2. To delevelop actual useful design or ideas locally for how things might work, ie. blueprints to your idea to develop with the community, project plans, workshops, events etc.

## Suggested use of this site:
1. Review the good practice pages in the Wiki pages and propose your own to add to the library
2. Create an issue to discuss a topic around any of the good practice examples or to create an activity that you believe is needed to progress the aims
4. Create a project to initiate any of the good practice examples (the Help.MD file will develop but simply speaking this tool can be used to develop and share online project plans and the outputs you/ we develop.
5. Add other resources that may be useful such as designs, plans etc which the community can add to and improve
6. Engage with materials on the respository such as the local vision for Walsall

## What this repository is not
* Whilst it can be used for and by the general public, this repository is for volunteers, professionals and citizens to co-create, co-design and co-produce outputs; it is not a mainstream communication channel
* This repository is not an organisationally 'owned' hosted site or resource but rather a 'shared' community resource to help generate ideas through colloboration across diverse communities and parties. Github as a tool whilst predominantly used for hosted computer programming code projects is not exclusively used as such. Github is an under used 'free' colloborate tool that could help co-production in health and social care.

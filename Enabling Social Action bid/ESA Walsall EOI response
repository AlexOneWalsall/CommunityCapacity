#Section Two - Local Authority Endorsement
## 5. Which local authority is applying?

## 6. Endorsement of the Local Authority Chief Executive (or equivalent) 
We will only accept one EOI from each of the 326 Local Authority areas in England. To ensure that we only receive one EOI from any given area, you must obtain the written support and endorsement from your Chief Executive Officer (or equivalent leadership post). The endorsement can take the form of a letter of support or a declaration.  

# Section Three - EOI Questions
We'll use your answers to the next six questions to decide who to shortlist for ESA partnerships. Please write no more than 350 words in each answer.

## 8. Please tell us a bit about the specific SA initiative and background: What are the aims and objectives of the SA initiative? Is this a newly emerging initiative or has it been in development for some time? What role does co-production play in the shaping, design and delivery of the initiative? 


## 9. Who are some of the primary/potential partners involved in the project? Who are the key actors within the initiative? What roles and responsibilities do they undertake? Which groups do you anticipate having a direct relationship with the research team?
  

## 10. How does the SA initiative link to the councilâ€™s strategy for commissioning? How does this fit into the broader context of commissioning within the Local Authority? Is there the likelihood of continued funding or other support for the project beyond the next 12 months?
 

## 11. What are the aims of the project from January 2019 - January 2020 and the anticipated impacts? Give a brief outline of the project plan during this period and how working with the ESA team project will add value to this. The research team will only be directly involved for 12 months from January 2019 and are unable to consider projects that will launch after January 2019.


## 12. Why would this be a good project for the ESA programme to work with? Explain why your initiative would have useful learning for the broader national picture of SA development? Is there something distinctive/innovative that you are trying to do that others could learn from? Are you tackling a common challenge but in a distinctive fashion? 

## 13.  What benefits do you hope your project will gain from working with the research team? You need to be clear both about what type of learning you are seeking in order to drive your initiative forward or to demonstrate its impact and why working with the research team might be the best way to achieve this?

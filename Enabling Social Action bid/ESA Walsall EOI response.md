# Section Three - EOI Questions
We'll use your answers to the next six questions to decide who to shortlist for ESA partnerships. 
Please write no more than 350 words in each answer.

## 8. Please tell us a bit about the specific SA initiative and background: 
### What are the aims and objectives of the SA initiative? 
The Resilient Communities social action initiative aims to leverage strenghths through supporting existing initiatives whilst developing a broader range of services within the numerous and diverse communities of the Metropolitan region of Walsall; that  increases the social capital of the area through enhance resilience and capacity.
### Is this a newly emerging initiative or has it been in development for some time? 
This project is an existing strand of the Walsall Together Programme.  Walsall Public Health team has already launched a successful social presribing project as part of this initiative and is 'pump priming' community initiatives such as befriending services which engages the community in volunteering activities.  This scheme, called 'Making Connections', has been running now for 18 months.
### What role does co-production play in the shaping, design and delivery of the initiative? 
The Resilient Communities project at present is tangible through just the 'Making Connections' initiative. Our aspiration is to develop a broader vision and a range of activities through designing and co-producing what the communities both wants and needs.  Whilst we have a vision which is reflective of the internal directorates spanning economy and environment, public health, childrens and adult services, along with colleagues in the police, fire service and through Walsall Together, with our other statutory partners including the NHS CCG and housing, we have plans and activities in motion to more widely engage citizens in social action; including democratically and politically as well as in our communities.

## 9. Who are some of the primary/potential partners involved in the project? 
### Who are the key actors within the initiative? 
Key actors include: 
* The LA Integrated Commissioners for Childrens, Adults and Economy and Environment (with a focus on green spaces, activities, leisure, employment and regeneration)
* The CEO and lead for the Voluntary and Community Services Sector partner
* CCG and Public Health commisioner colleagues (already engaged in social prescribing)
### What roles and responsibilities do they undertake? 

### Which groups do you anticipate having a direct relationship with the research team?
At relevant stages of the initiative, we are expecting that all the parties above would be engaged in some form in the research.  The relationship however with the research team would be coordinated by the local athority lead.  

## 10. How does the SA initiative link to the councilâ€™s strategy for commissioning? 
### How does this fit into the broader context of commissioning within the Local Authority? 
The commissioning intentions within Adult Services in the council underpin the current council corporate plan 2018-2021.  Our directorate [commissioning intentions are explained here in more detail](https://go.walsall.gov.uk/Portals/0/Uploads/SocialCare/Adult%20Social%20Care%20Directorate%20Plan%202017-%202018.pdf)
### Is there the likelihood of continued funding or other support for the project beyond the next 12 months?
The project is expected to take 2-3 years in this stage of the initiative and is also a permanent element of the Walsall Together strategy which is the forum for the strategy and plans for integrated commissioning across the Sustainability Transformation Plans and the use of the Better Care Funds. 

## 11. What are the aims of the project from January 2019 - January 2020 and the anticipated impacts? 
### Give a brief outline of the project plan during this period and how working with the ESA team project will add value to this. 
The research team will only be directly involved for 12 months from January 2019 and are unable to consider projects that will launch after January 2019.


## 12. Why would this be a good project for the ESA programme to work with? 
### Explain why your initiative would have useful learning for the broader national picture of SA development? 
Whilst there are pockets of exceptional good practice, the Walsall area has over a number of years lacked investment and focus in to the voluntary and community sector.  There is consequently more to gain, with greater leaps forward with potentially evolutionationay change.  We are proud of our past and present but also not wedded to old ways of working.  
### Is there something distinctive/innovative that you are trying to do that others could learn from? 
A unique approach is being taken to how we use digital platforms to enhance the degree of involvement and engagement of the wider community.  For example, we made use of GitHub (an open source digital platform used normally by developers, coders and software engineers) to develop our vision with the wider community and make it easier for people less able to attend events physically through using an open tool.
### Are you tackling a common challenge but in a distinctive fashion? 
Building community capacity and resilience is a common challenge; the [Socail Care Institute for Excellence](https://www.scie.org.uk/) has a unit that [leads on a member network building community capacity](https://www.scie.org.uk/news/opinions/building-community-capacity) which the council and the lead for this initiative are members of. What is particularly distinctive however in our approach that has been an emergent strategy is our working colloboratively across our directorate partners, as evidenced in the partners above.
## 13.  What benefits do you hope your project will gain from working with the research team? 

### You need to be clear both about what type of learning you are seeking in order to drive your initiative forward or to demonstrate its impact and why working with the research team might be the best way to achieve this?
